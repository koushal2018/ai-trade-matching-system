Review the changes and suggest relevant AgentCore MCP server capabilities:\n\n1. **Tool Integration (Gateway)**: If the agent needs external tool access, suggest connecting to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway. Reference terraform/agentcore/agentcore_gateway.tf and configs/AGENTCORE_GATEWAY_README.md.\n\n2. **Memory Integration**: If the agent handles conversations or needs context persistence, suggest Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory. Reference terraform/agentcore/agentcore_memory.tf and configs/AGENTCORE_MEMORY_README.md.\n\n3. **Identity Management**: If the agent needs secure access control or authentication, suggest Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Identity. Reference terraform/agentcore/cognito.tf and configs/AGENTCORE_IDENTITY_README.md.\n\n4. **Framework Integrations**: Based on the agent implementation, suggest relevant framework integrations:\n   - For multi-agent swarms: Strands SDK (current implementation in deployment/swarm/)\n   - For complex workflows: LangGraph integration\n   - For other patterns: Mention available framework options\n\nProvide specific code examples or configuration snippets relevant to the file being edited."
