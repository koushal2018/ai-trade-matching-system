    "prompt": "Review this AgentCore-related file and ensure it follows these development practices:\n\n1. **CLI-First Approach**: Verify the implementation starts with command-line access. If adding a web interface, ensure it's a separate layer on top of CLI functionality, not tightly coupled.\n\n2. **Built-in Tools Usage**: Check if the code uses built-in tools (web browsing, code execution, etc.) securely. Ensure proper security integration and avoid reimplementing functionality that built-in tools already provide.\n\n3. **Tool Resource Reuse**: Look for tool resource definitions. Suggest creating reusable tool resources that can be shared across multiple sessions. This helps manage network settings and permissions efficiently rather than recreating them each time.\n\nProvide specific recommendations if any of these practices are not being followed."
