Verify the developer is using the CORRECT VERSION of the documentation for any new dependencies\n2. Check that imports and module usage align with official documentation patterns\n3. Ensure all module properties (inputs, outputs, required vs optional parameters) are properly understood and documented\n4. Look for signs of copy-pasted code from StackOverflow or other sources without proper understanding\n5. Verify that any AWS service usage (Bedrock, DynamoDB, S3, etc.) follows the official AWS SDK documentation patterns\n6. Check that configuration values and parameters are not just \"set and forget\" but are intentionally chosen based on documentation\n\nIf you find potential issues, provide specific guidance on:\n- Which official documentation to consult (with version numbers)\n- What specific sections to review (module overview, properties, examples)\n- How to verify the implementation matches documented patterns\n- Questions the developer should answer to demonstrate understanding\n\nRemember: Code that \"works\" without understanding is technical debt. Prioritize documentation → established repositories → debugging resources (in that order)."
