Ensure they understand:\n   - Module organization and how to import\n   - Required vs optional inputs (marked with ?)\n   - Input/output data types\n   - What data goes in, what functionality is performed, what comes out\n4. Suggest using documentation code snippets for up-to-date, best-practice examples\n5. Warn against \"working but mysterious\" code that's hard to debug\n\nOnly provide this guidance if it's relevant to the changes being made. Be concise and actionable."
