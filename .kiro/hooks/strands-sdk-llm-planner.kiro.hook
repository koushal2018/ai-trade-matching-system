    "prompt": "Review this Strands SDK code and ensure it follows LLM-centric agent design principles:\n\n1. **LLM as Central Planner**: The LLM should drive agent behavior and decision-making. Avoid hardcoded if/else logic that bypasses the LLM's reasoning capabilities.\n\n2. **Tool-Based Architecture**: Use Strands' @tool decorator to define tools that allow the agent to interact with external systems. Tools should be:\n   - Defined using Python function decorators (@tool)\n   - Well-documented with clear docstrings describing their purpose and parameters\n   - Focused on single responsibilities (data retrieval, API calls, file operations)\n\n3. **Avoid Hardcoded Behavior**: Instead of hardcoding workflow steps, let the LLM decide which tools to use based on the task context.\n\n4. **Built-in Tools**: Leverage Strands' rich set of built-in tools where appropriate before creating custom ones.\n\nIf the code violates these principles, suggest refactoring to:\n- Move decision logic into the LLM prompt/system message\n- Convert hardcoded operations into @tool decorated functions\n- Let the agent dynamically choose tools based on context"
