    **TASK FOCUS:** Store comprehensive trade data in DynamoDB database with data integrity preservation.
    
    **STRICT WORKFLOW (NO DEVIATIONS):**
    1. Use "List files in directory" tool to check .data/ folder for JSON files
    2. Use "Read a file's content" tool to read the FIRST JSON file found in .data/ folder (read ONCE only)
    3. Parse the JSON string into a dictionary
    
    **FILE LOCATION LOGIC:**
    - Look for ANY .json file in the .data/ directory
    - If multiple JSON files exist, prioritize files containing "trade" or "counterparty" in the name
    - If no matching pattern, use the first JSON file found
    - The actual filename may vary (e.g., trade_data.json, counterparty_trades.json, extracted_data.json)
    
    **MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**
    - Read the file ONLY ONCE after identifying it
    - Determine database based on content:
      - Use DynamoDB to store data in CounterpartyTradeDate if the file contains counterparty trade data
      - Use DynamoDB to store data in BankTradeData if the file contains bank trade data
    - Use Trade_ID as the primary key for storage
    - If Trade_ID exists, update the record; if not, insert a new record
    - Ensure idempotent operations to prevent duplicates
    - Maintain data integrity and accuracy during storage
    - Optimize for efficient retrieval during trade matching
    - Ensure database schema supports multi-asset class trades
    - Implement error handling for read/write operations
    - Log each storage action with timestamp and action type (insert/update)
    - Confirm successful storage with a concise message
    - Preserve ALL data fields from the comprehensive JSON structure
    - Do NOT read the file multiple times
    - Do NOT look for a "status" field - the JSON contains trade data directly
    - Do NOT use PDFExtractorTool or delegate tasks
    - Do NOT provide database optimization advice
    - Do NOT suggest system improvements
   
    **TASK BOUNDARY:** You are ONLY responsible for data storage. Do not provide suggestions 
    about data architecture, system design, or operational improvements.
    
  expected_output: >
    Confirmation of successful storage containing ONLY:
    - "Stored trade [Trade_ID] in [database_name]"
    - "Action: [inserted/updated]"
    - Database record count
    - NO additional commentary or suggestions

    **CRITICAL TRADE MATCHING TASK - APPLY YOUR 20+ YEARS OF EXPERTISE**
    
    You need to match trades stored in DynamoDB Tables BankTradeData and CounterpartyTradeDate
     If the tables do not exist or are empty,return an error message indicating the issue or ask the previous agent to populate them. If they exist, proceed with the matching.
    if they are incorrectly updated i.e bank trade data in counterparty db or vice versa, identify and flag this as a critical error to your co-workers and ask them fix it and send it back to you
    
    
    **USE YOUR VETERAN EXPERTISE TO:**
    
    1. **ANALYZE DATA STRUCTURES:**
       - Examine both databases to understand their schemas and field naming conventions
       - Identify which fields map between systems (e.g., "Trade ID" vs "Reference Number")
       - Recognize counterparty-specific formatting patterns you've seen in your 20 years
       - Document any data quality issues or missing critical fields
    
    2. **APPLY PROFESSIONAL MATCHING LOGIC:**
       - Use your knowledge of what constitutes a match vs a break in real trading operations
       - Apply appropriate tolerances based on asset class and field type (you know when 0.01 matters)
       - Recognize rounding differences vs real discrepancies
       - Identify systematic booking problems vs one-off errors
       - Consider T+1 settlement requirements and their impact on matching urgency
    
    3. **PERFORM INTELLIGENT MATCHING:**
       - Match trades using your understanding of critical vs non-critical fields
       - Apply ISDA standards and regional market conventions as appropriate
       - Recognize when seeming differences are actually identical (format variations)
       - Flag true exceptions that need escalation vs false positives
       - Handle each asset class with its specific matching requirements
    
    4. **VALIDATE WITH PROFESSIONAL SKEPTICISM:**
       - A 100% match rate is a RED FLAG - real-world matching NEVER achieves this
       - Question any matching logic that produces unrealistic results
       - Apply the "smell test" - does this match make business sense?
       - Consider counterparty relationships and their typical error patterns
    
    5. **CLASSIFY MATCHES PROFESSIONALLY:**
       Based on your experience, categorize each trade comparison as:
       - MATCHED: All critical fields align within acceptable tolerances
       - PROBABLE MATCH: Minor discrepancies that your experience suggests are not breaks
       - REVIEW REQUIRED: Discrepancies that need human investigation
       - BREAK: Clear mismatch requiring immediate attention
       - DUPLICATE/ERROR: Systematic issues requiring escalation
    
    6. **APPLY CONTEXT AND NUANCE:**
       - Use your knowledge of how Goldman vs JPMorgan vs other counterparties book trades
       - Recognize exotic derivative component matching requirements
       - Understand when to apply strict matching vs intelligent tolerance
       - Identify patterns that indicate upstream system issues
    
    **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
    - DO NOT blindly match everything - this would be malpractice
    - DO apply the professional skepticism you've developed over 20 years
    - DO recognize that perfect matching is impossible - expect 70-95% match rates
    - DO identify and explain WHY trades don't match, not just that they don't
    - DO prioritize breaks by settlement risk and financial impact

    **PROFESSIONAL MATCHING REPORT DELIVERABLES:**
    
    1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:**
       - Overall match rate with your professional assessment (is it reasonable?)
       - Key concerns or systematic issues identified
       - Comparison to typical match rates you've seen in your experience
       - Immediate actions required for T+1 settlement
    
    2. **DATABASE UPDATES:**
       Update matching_results.db with your professional judgment:
       - Match determinations with confidence scores
       - Specific reasons for any breaks (using your knowledge of common issues)
       - Risk assessment for unmatched trades
       - Recommended actions based on your experience
    
    3. **DETAILED ANALYSIS REPORT:**
       Save to ./data/{unique_identifier}_matching_report.md and also update the DynamoDB table TradeMatches with:
       - Matched trades with any caveats or conditions
       - Breaks analysis with root cause identification
       - Pattern recognition (are breaks systematic or random?)
       - Counterparty-specific issues you've identified
       - Recommendations based on your 20 years of experience
       - False positives avoided through your expertise
    
    4. **PROFESSIONAL VALIDATION:**
       - Explain WHY your match rate is realistic (not 100%)
       - Identify which counterparties have higher break rates and why
       - Highlight any data quality issues affecting matching
       - Provide confidence assessment in your matching decisions
    
    **YOUR EXPERTISE MATTERS:**
    Use your deep understanding of trade matching to produce a report that a junior analyst 
    couldn't - one that shows the nuance, context, and professional judgment that comes from 
    processing millions of trades. A report that operations managers can trust because it 
    reflects real-world matching, not naive algorithmic comparison.
