# AI Trade Matching System

## Description

The AI Trade Matching System is an intelligent, cloud-native platform that automates the complex process of trade reconciliation between financial institutions and their counterparties. Built on AWS infrastructure with advanced AI capabilities, the system processes trade confirmations from multiple sources, extracts structured data using machine learning, and performs intelligent matching to identify discrepancies and exceptions.

The platform leverages Amazon Bedrock's Claude AI models for document processing and natural language understanding, combined with sophisticated matching algorithms to handle the nuances of financial trade data. It features a comprehensive web portal for real-time monitoring, human-in-the-loop (HITL) review workflows, and detailed audit trails to ensure regulatory compliance.

Key components include:
- **AI-Powered Document Processing**: Automated extraction of trade data from PDF confirmations using computer vision and NLP
- **Intelligent Trade Matching**: Advanced algorithms with configurable similarity weights and tolerance thresholds
- **Exception Management**: Automated routing and escalation of unmatched trades with severity classification
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Interactive dashboard with live metrics, agent health monitoring, and processing status
- **Audit & Compliance**: Comprehensive logging, audit trails, and regulatory reporting capabilities
